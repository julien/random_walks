random walks
------------

This is based on Daniel Shiffman's [Nature Of Code](http://natureofcode.com)
random walker, but done with WebGL.

The code is far from being clean (e.g. some shared stuff could be placed in an extra JS file to avoid duplication)
but it was done in less than an hour and I don't really care.

Feel free to tweak and submit PR's
